## Bites (Datadog wordle clone)

Put together for the inaugural Gobstopper hackathon, Bites is a clone of the viral word game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). If you know how to play wordle then you also know how to play Bites. The catch is that instead of guessing just any old five-letter word, our bank of correct answers all relate to the Datadog platform. For example, possible correct answers include words such as _trace_, _agent_, and _hosts_. 


So how many possible five-letter "Datadog" words are there you ask? Great question! Check out the `dd_words.csv` file to find out (it's not a lot). If you come up with good words, feel free to update that file as well!

## Getting started

- This isn't deployed anywhere so to play you can [clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and then open the `bites.html` file on your browser. Should be able to play around with it from there.
